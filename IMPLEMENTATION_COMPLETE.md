# 🎉 Multi-Group System Implementation - COMPLETE!

All code for the multi-group system has been successfully implemented! This document provides a complete overview and next steps.

---

## 📋 What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema & Migrations ✅
- **New Tables:**
  - `groups` - Stores group information with unique invite codes
  - `group_members` - Tracks membership and roles (admin/member)
- **Updated Tables:**
  - `players` - Added `groupId` (required) and `userId` (nullable for guest/registered players)
  - `matchdays` - Added `groupId` (required)
- **Migration Files:**
  - SQL migration: `drizzle/0004_add_groups_and_update_schema.sql`
  - Data migration: `scripts/migrate-to-groups.ts`

### 2. Authentication & Authorization ✅
**Permission Guards** (`src/lib/auth-guards.ts`):
- `isGroupMember()` - Check membership
- `isGroupAdmin()` - Check admin status
- `requireGroupMember()` - Enforce membership
- `requireGroupAdmin()` - Enforce admin access
- `canManageMatchdays()` - Check management permissions

### 3. State Management ✅
**Group Context** (`src/lib/hooks/use-group-context.tsx`):
- Manages active group state
- Persists to cookies (30-day expiry)
- Syncs across browser tabs via localStorage

**Group Hooks** (`src/lib/hooks/use-groups.ts`):
- `fetchUserGroups()` - Get all user's groups
- `createGroup()` - Create new group
- `joinGroup()` - Join via invite code
- `updateGroup()` - Update group details
- `regenerateInviteCode()` - Generate new code
- `fetchGroupMembers()` - Get members
- `updateMemberRole()` - Change roles
- `removeMember()` - Remove member

### 4. UI Components ✅
**GroupSwitcher** (`src/components/groups/GroupSwitcher.tsx`):
- Replaces "Stanga" text in header
- Dropdown showing current group and all user groups
- Quick access to join/create group

**JoinGroupModal** (`src/components/groups/JoinGroupModal.tsx`):
- Enter 6-character invite code
- Validates and joins group
- Updates active group automatically

**CreateGroupModal** (`src/components/groups/CreateGroupModal.tsx`):
- Create group with name and description
- Auto-generates unique invite code
- Creator becomes admin

**Group Settings Page** (`src/app/groups/[id]/settings/page.tsx`):
- Edit group name and description
- Display invite code with copy button
- Regenerate invite code
- View all members with role badges
- Promote/demote members
- Remove members with confirmation
- Admin-only access

### 5. API Routes ✅
**Group Management:**
- `GET /api/groups` - List user's groups
- `POST /api/groups` - Create group
- `POST /api/groups/join` - Join via invite code
- `GET /api/groups/[id]` - Get group details
- `PATCH /api/groups/[id]` - Update group (admin)
- `DELETE /api/groups/[id]` - Soft delete (admin)
- `GET /api/groups/[id]/members` - List members
- `PATCH /api/groups/[id]/members/[userId]` - Update role (admin)
- `DELETE /api/groups/[id]/members/[userId]` - Remove member (admin)
- `POST /api/groups/[id]/regenerate-code` - New invite code (admin)

**Player Claiming:**
- `POST /api/players/[id]/claim` - Link guest player to user
- `DELETE /api/players/[id]/claim` - Unlink player

**Updated Routes (Group Filtering):**
- `GET /api/matchdays` - Filters by `groupId`
- `POST /api/matchdays` - Requires `groupId`, validates admin
- `GET /api/players` - Filters by `groupId`
- `POST /api/players` - Requires `groupId`, validates admin
- `GET /api/stats/overall` - Filters by `groupId`

### 6. Updated Hooks ✅
All data-fetching hooks now filter by active group:
- `use-matchdays.ts` - Auto-adds `groupId`, validates admin on create
- `use-players.ts` - Auto-adds `groupId`, validates admin on create
- `use-stats.ts` - Passes `groupId` to API

## 🚀 How to Run Migrations

### Prerequisites
1. **Create `.env` file** in project root (copy from `env.example`)
2. **Set `DATABASE_URL`** to your PostgreSQL connection string:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/stanga"
   ```
3. **Ensure database is running**

### Migration Steps

```bash
# 1. Verify .env file exists and has DATABASE_URL
cat .env | grep DATABASE_URL

# 2. Push schema changes to database
npm run db:push

# 3. Run data migration to create FC Yarkon and migrate existing data
npx tsx scripts/migrate-to-groups.ts
```

### What the Migration Does
1. Creates `groups` and `group_members` tables
2. Adds `groupId` columns to `players` and `matchdays`
3. Creates **"FC Yarkon"** default group with unique invite code
4. Migrates **all existing matchdays** to FC Yarkon
5. Migrates **all existing players** to FC Yarkon
6. Makes **all existing users admins** of FC Yarkon
7. Outputs the invite code (save this!)

### After Migration
- All existing users will see their data in "FC Yarkon" group
- All existing users are admins (full access)
- Users can create new groups via the header dropdown
- Users can join other groups via invite codes
- Data is properly isolated between groups

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Sign In** → User is authenticated
2. **Auto-Select Group** → First group (FC Yarkon after migration) is selected
3. **View Data** → See matchdays, players, stats for active group only
4. **Switch Groups** → Click group name in header, select different group
5. **Create Group** → Click "Create Group", enter name/description
6. **Join Group** → Click "Join Group", enter 6-character code
7. **Manage Group** → Admins access settings via `/groups/[id]/settings`

### Data Isolation

Each group has completely separate:
- **Matchdays** - Only visible to group members
- **Players** - Can be guest (name only) or registered (linked to user)
- **Teams** - Created per matchday (inherits group from matchday)
- **Games** - Belongs to matchday (inherits group)
- **Stats** - Calculated per group

### Permission Model

**Admins can:**
- Create/edit/delete matchdays
- Create/edit/delete players
- Edit group details
- Manage members (promote, demote, remove)
- Regenerate invite codes

**Members can:**
- View all group data
- Log game events (goals, assists) during active games
- Cannot create or edit matchdays/players
- Cannot access group settings

### Player Types

**Guest Players:**
- Only have a name
- No `userId` (null)
- Specific to one group
- Can be "claimed" by registered users

**Registered Players:**
- Linked to a user via `userId`
- Can be tracked across groups (future feature)
- Shows who they are in the system

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After running migrations, test these scenarios:

### Group Management
- [ ] See FC Yarkon in header dropdown
- [ ] Create a new group
- [ ] Verify invite code was generated
- [ ] Copy invite code
- [ ] Join group with invite code (use different user/browser)
- [ ] Switch between groups via header dropdown

### Data Isolation
- [ ] Create matchday in Group A
- [ ] Switch to Group B
- [ ] Verify matchday from Group A is not visible
- [ ] Create matchday in Group B
- [ ] Switch back to Group A
- [ ] Verify matchday from Group B is not visible

### Permissions
- [ ] As admin: Create matchday (should work)
- [ ] As admin: Create player (should work)
- [ ] As admin: Access group settings (should work)
- [ ] As member: Try to create matchday (should fail)
- [ ] As member: Try to access settings (should fail or show read-only)

### Group Settings (Admin)
- [ ] Edit group name
- [ ] Edit group description
- [ ] Copy invite code
- [ ] Regenerate invite code
- [ ] View member list
- [ ] Promote member to admin
- [ ] Demote admin to member
- [ ] Remove member from group

### Player Claiming
- [ ] Create guest player (no userId)
- [ ] Call `POST /api/players/[id]/claim` (via API or future UI)
- [ ] Verify player now has your userId
- [ ] Call `DELETE /api/players/[id]/claim`
- [ ] Verify player userId is null again

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Migration Issues

**"DATABASE_URL is required"**
- Create `.env` file in project root
- Add `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."`
- Restart terminal

**"Group FC Yarkon already exists"**
- Migration has already run
- Check database: `SELECT * FROM groups;`
- Skip data migration if already done

**"No users found"**
- Normal if database is fresh
- Users will be added to groups on first sign-in
- Default group will be created by first user

### Runtime Issues

**"No active group"**
- User hasn't joined any groups yet
- After migration, users need to sign in again
- First group should auto-select

**"Not authorized"**
- Check user is member of the group
- Check role (admin/member) for the action
- Verify group permissions in database

**Data not showing**
- Verify active group is correct (check header)
- Check network tab for API errors
- Verify groupId matches in database

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Run database migrations (see instructions above)
2. Test with existing users
3. Create a second group to test switching
4. Test invite code flow

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Public group discovery
- [ ] Cross-group player stats for registered players
- [ ] Invite link expiration
- [ ] Group-level settings (privacy, who can create matchdays)
- [ ] Transfer group ownership
- [ ] Group activity feed
- [ ] Invite links (auto-fill code): `/groups/join/ABC123`

### UI Enhancements
- [ ] Add "Claim Player" button in player list
- [ ] Show indicator when player is linked to current user
- [ ] Add group badge in player rows
- [ ] Settings link in group dropdown
- [ ] Group member count in dropdown
