Add suppressHydrationWarning usage guidance.\n- Add a small ThemeToggle client component using shadcn Button for later use in the UI.\n\n2) React Query provider\n- Create src/app/providers.tsx (client). Instantiate a single QueryClient with defaultOptions. Example defaults: queries: { retry: 1, staleTime: 30000, refetchOnWindowFocus: false }.\n- Conditionally include ReactQueryDevtools only in development (dynamic import or process.env.NODE_ENV check).\n- Export Providers that wrap children with QueryClientProvider and ThemeProvider (and leave a placeholder for SessionProvider to be added by the auth task).\n\n3) Root layout and shell\n- Create src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx (server OK, but can be client if needed for responsive logic). Include page landmarks: header (with optional ThemeToggle), main (id='main-content'), and a slot for children. Add a visually-hidden 'Skip to content' link anchored to #main-content positioned at top; make it visible on :focus.\n- Create src/components/navigation/BottomNav.tsx (client). Use nav[aria-label='Primary'] with list of 5 tabs: Dashboard, Matchdays, Players, Stats, Profile. Each item uses lucide-react icons and enforces 44x44px minimum target (Tailwind: min-w-11 min-h-11 px-3 py-2 flex items-center justify-center). Use semantic <a> links via next/link, aria-current='page' when active, and focus-visible styles.\n- Create src/app/layout.tsx as a server component using the Inter font: html lang='en' suppressHydrationWarning, body className includes font variable and 'antialiased'. Wrap children in <Providers>. Render <AppShell> with children and <BottomNav />.\n\n4) App Router patterns and structure\n- Keep server components by default for pages/routes. Mark interactive components with 'use client' (e.g., BottomNav, ThemeToggle, forms, DnD).\n- Maintain route groups created in subtask 1 (app/(public)/(tabs)/...). Add basic placeholder content to each page to validate navigation.\n\n5) Accessibility defaults\n- Ensure focus-visible styles are present via Tailwind utilities (ring-2 ring-offset-2) either globally or via component classes.\n- Confirm semantic landmarks: header, nav, main.

The following components and features have been completed:\n\nCore Components Built:\n1. TeamManagement.tsx - Main container component with full DnD integration\n2. TeamCard - Individual team display with droppable zones and player management\n3. PlayerChip - Draggable player components with visual feedback\n4. UnassignedPlayersCard - Droppable zone for unassigned players\n5. Badge.tsx - UI component for status indicators\n\nKey Features Implemented:\n- DnD Functionality: Full drag-and-drop with dnd-kit integration, including draggable player chips with visual feedback, droppable team zones with hover states, and an unassigned players area as a drop target. Long-press activation is set with a 200ms delay and 5px tolerance.\n- Team Management: Initialization of 3 color-coded teams with player count tracking.\n- Player Assignment: Drag-to-assign, click-to-unassign, and quick-assign buttons.\n- Validation: Team size limits with visual indicators for full teams.\n- Accessibility: Fallback controls and keyboard navigation support.\n- Real-time Updates: React Query integration with optimistic UI.\n\nIntegration Complete:\n- The matchday detail page has been updated to enable the Teams tab.\n- Connected to existing API endpoints via the use-teams.ts hook.\n- Integrated with the player management system.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Test the implementation end-to-end.\n- Verify DnD functionality on mobile devices.\n- Add any missing error handling or edge cases.\n</info added on 2025-09-21T07:12:38.573Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-21T07:16:44.711Z>\nRun a database migration to add the missing columns (color_token, color_hex, formation_json) to the teams table.

Utility Classes Available:\n   - `.cursor-pointer` - Included in my global rules for manual application\n   - `.cursor-not-allowed` - Included for disabled states\n   - Standard Tailwind cursor utilities (cursor-grab, cursor-move, etc.) work alongside global rules\n\n3.
